	abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) aims to improve organizational activities and their outcomes by managing the underlying processes. To achieve this, it is often necessary to consider information from various sources, including unstructured textual documents. Therefore, researchers have developed several BPM-specific solutions that extract information from textual documents using Natural Language Processing techniques. These solutions are specific to their respective tasks and cannot accomplish multiple process-related problems as a general-purpose instrument. However, in light of the recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, such a general-purpose instrument with multiple applications now appears attainable. In this paper, we illustrate how LLMs can accomplish text-related BPM tasks by applying a specific LLM to three exemplary tasks: mining imperative process models from textual descriptions, mining declarative process models from textual descriptions, and assessing the suitability of process tasks from textual descriptions for robotic process automation. We show that, without extensive configuration or prompt engineering, LLMs perform comparably to or better than existing solutions and discuss implications for future BPM research as well as practical usage.},

	abstract = {Business Process Modeling Languages (BPML’s) are continuously getting attraction of software development communities due to the fact of specifying complex business requirements with simplicity. However, the development of business process models from textual requirements through existing BPML’s is a time consuming task. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are commonly applied to automatically generate business process models from textual requirements. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a well-known BPML. This article comprehensively investigates modern techniques, tools and trends for the generation of BPMN models from textual requirements by utilizing NLP techniques. Particularly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to select and evaluate 36 research studies published in the span of 2010–2018. As a result, 11 NLP and 8 BPMN tools are identified. Furthermore, 8 commonly generated BPMN constructs are recognized. Finally, a comparative analysis of NLP and BPMN tools is performed with the help of important evaluation parameters. It is concluded that the existing NLP techniques and tools significantly simplify the process of BPMN models generation from textual requirements. However, the existing approaches are inadequate to be applied in the industries, especially for real-time systems.},

	abstract = {Purpose This study aims to draw the attention of business process management (BPM) research and practice to the textual data generated in the processes and the potential of meaningful insights extraction. The authors apply standard natural language processing (NLP) approaches to gain valuable knowledge in the form of business process (BP) complexity concept suggested in the study. It is built on the objective, subjective and meta-knowledge extracted from the BP textual data and encompassing semantics, syntax and stylistics. As a result, the authors aim to create awareness about cognitive, attention and reading efforts forming the textual data-based BP complexity. The concept serves as a basis for the development of various decision-support solutions for BP workers. Design/methodology/approach The starting point is an investigation of the complexity concept in the BPM literature to develop an understanding of the related complexity research and to put the textual data-based BP complexity in its context. Afterward, utilizing the linguistic foundations and the theory of situation awareness (SA), the concept is empirically developed and evaluated in a real-world application case using qualitative interview-based and quantitative data-based methods. Findings In the practical, real-world application, the authors confirmed that BP textual data could be used to predict BP complexity from the semantic, syntactic and stylistic viewpoints. The authors were able to prove the value of this knowledge about the BP complexity formed based on the (1) professional contextual experience of the BP worker enriched by the awareness of cognitive efforts required for BP execution (objective knowledge), (2) business emotions enriched by attention efforts (subjective knowledge) and (3) quality of the text, i.e. professionalism, expertise and stress level of the text author, enriched by reading efforts (meta-knowledge). In particular, the BP complexity concept has been applied to an industrial example of Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) change management (CHM) Information Technology (IT) ticket processing. The authors used IT ticket texts from two samples of 28,157 and 4,625 tickets as the basis for the analysis. The authors evaluated the concept with the help of manually labeled tickets and a rule-based approach using historical ticket execution data. Having a recommendation character, the results showed to be useful in creating awareness regarding cognitive, attention and reading efforts for ITIL CHM BP workers coordinating the IT ticket processing. Originality/value While aiming to draw attention to those valuable insights inherent in BP textual data, the authors propose an unconventional approach to BP complexity definition through the lens of textual data. Hereby, the authors address the challenges specified by BPM researchers, i.e. focus on semantics in the development of vocabularies and organization- and sector-specific adaptation of standard NLP techniques.},

The purpose is to make process information accessible to various stakeholders, including those who are not familiar with reading and interpreting the complex execution logic of process models. Despite this merit, there is a clear risk that model and text become misaligned when changes are not applied to both descriptions consistently. For organizations with hundreds of different processes, the effort required to identify and clear up such conflicts is considerable. To support organizations in keeping their process descriptions consistent, we present an approach to automatically identify inconsistencies between a process model and a corresponding textual description. Our approach detects cases where the two process representations describe activities in different orders and detect process model activities not contained in the textual description. A quantitative evaluation with 53 real-life model-text pairs demonstrates that our approach accurately identifies inconsistencies between model and text.},

These event data can be used to analyze the process using process mining techniques to discover the real process, measure conformance to a given process model, or to enhance existing models with performance information. Mapping the produced events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process mining results. In order to accomplish this mapping with low manual effort, we developed a semi-automatic approach that maps events to activities using insights from behavioral analysis and label analysis. The approach extracts Declare constraints from both the log and the model to build matching constraints to efficiently reduce the number of possible mappings. These mappings are further reduced using techniques from natural language processing, which allow for a matching based on labels and external knowledge sources. The evaluation with synthetic and real-life data demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach and its robustness toward non-conforming execution logs.},

The authors focused on a process and ontology integration approach by extracting the activities, roles and other concepts related to the process models from organizational sources using natural language processing techniques. As part of this study, a process ontology population (PrOnPo) methodology and tool is developed, which uses natural language parsers for extracting and interpreting the sentences and populating an event-driven process chain ontology in a fully automated or semi-automated (user assisted) manner. The purpose of this paper is to present applications of PrOnPo tool in different domains. Design/methodology/approach A multiple case study is conducted by selecting five different domains with different types of guidelines. Process ontologies are developed using the PrOnPo tool in a semi-automated and fully automated fashion and manually. The resulting ontologies are compared and evaluated in terms of time-effort and recall-precision metrics. Findings From five different domains, the results give an average of 70 percent recall and 80 percent precision for fully automated usage of the PrOnPo tool, showing that it is applicable and generalizable. In terms of efficiency, the effort spent for process ontology development is decreased from 250 person-minutes to 57 person-minutes (semi-automated). Originality/value The PrOnPo tool is the first one to automatically generate integrated process ontologies and process models from guidelines written in natural language.},

	abstract = {Textual process descriptions are widely used in organizations since they can be created and understood by virtually everyone. Because of their widespread use, they also provide a valuable source for process analysis, such as compliance checking. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language impedes the automated analysis of textual process descriptions. While human readers can use their context knowledge to correctly understand statements with multiple possible interpretations, automated tools currently have to make assumptions about their correct meaning. As a result, compliance-checking techniques are prone to draw incorrect conclusions about the proper execution of a process. To provide a comprehensive solution to these reasoning problems, we use this paper to introduce the concept of a behavioral space as a means to deal with behavioral ambiguity in textual process descriptions. A behavioral space captures all possible interpretations of a textual process description in a systematic manner. Thus, it avoids the problem of focusing on a single, possibly incorrect interpretation. We use a quantitative evaluation with a set of 47 textual process descriptions to demonstrate the usefulness of a behavioral space for compliance checking in the context of ambiguous texts.},

In this paper, a novel technique to align process models and textual descriptions is proposed. The technique is grounded on projecting knowledge extracted from these two representations into a uniform representation that is amenable for comparison. It applies a tailored linguistic analysis of each description, so that the important information is considered when aligning description’ elements. Compared to existing approaches that address this use case, our technique provides more comprehensive alignments, which encompass process model activities, events and gateways.

However, these techniques, so far, only focus on the extraction of traditional, imperative process models. The extraction of declarative process models, which allow to effectively capture complex process behavior in a compact fashion, has not been addressed. In this paper we close this gap by presenting the first automated approach for the extraction of declarative process models from natural language. To achieve this, we developed tailored Natural Language Processing techniques that identify activities and their inter-relations from textual constraint descriptions. A quantitative evaluation shows that our approach is able to generate constraints that closely resemble those established by humans.

	abstract = {Modeling is one of the core tasks in Business Process Management (BPM). It represents the most critical step in the BPM life cycle and is considered as a time consuming and costly task. These challenges raised the question of how researchers can save this cost by building tools that could support modeling experts in their work to reduce the manual workload. In this paper, we propose a Machine Translation (MT) like approach to deal with the problem of generating a business process model based on a textual description. We chose to follow a semantic transfer-based MT approach. Our approach consists of two main phases: The natural Language Analysis phase and BPMN diagram generation. Natural Language Analysis phase aims to analyze the text and extract the required knowledge. One of the main outputs for this phase is a Concept Map which summarizes the concepts of the related domain and the relationships between these concepts. This map represents a background for our processing in the second phase where we try to generate the “translation”, which is the BPMN diagram in our case. We achieve our goal in the second phase via a set of semantic, syntactic, and morphological manipulations. The approach has been implemented and evaluated usinga similarity metric based on the Graph Edit Distance. The results show that the proposed approach was able to generate models that are more than 81\% similar to those created manually by a human, outperforming the state of the art in this topic.},

	abstract = {Process modeling is a complex and important task in any business process management project. Gathering information to build a process model needs effort by analysts in different ways, such as interviews and document review. However, this documentation is not always well structured and can be difficult to be understood. Thus, techniques that allow the structuring and recognition of process elements in the documentation can help in the understanding of the process and, consequently, in the modeling activity. In this context, this paper proposes an approach to recognize business process elements in natural language texts. We defined a set of 32 mapping rules to recognize business process elements in texts using natural language processing techniques and which were identified through an empirical study in texts containing descriptions of a process. Furthermore, a prototype was developed and it showed promising results. The analyses of 70 texts revealed 73.61\% precision, 70.15\% recall and 71.82\% F-measure. Moreover, two surveys showed that 93.33\% of participants agree with the mapping rules and that the approach helps the analysts in both the time spent and the effort made in the process modeling task. This paper is a reiteration and an evolution of the work presented in Ferreira et al. [1].},

In this paper, we formalize the PME task into the multi-grained text classification problem, and propose a hierarchical neural network to effectively model and extract multi-grained information without manually-defined procedural features. Under this structure, we accordingly propose the coarse-to-fine (grained) learning mechanism, training multi-grained tasks in coarse-to-fine grained order to share the high-level knowledge for the low-level tasks. To evaluate our approach, we construct two multi-grained datasets from two different domains and conduct extensive experiments from different dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance and further investigations demonstrate its effectiveness.},

The actual relevance of business process management is, for instance, illustrated by the size of the BPM software market. A recent study of Global Industry Analysts forecasts that the global market for BPM software will reach a volume of over 5 billion US dollars by the year 2017 [18]. The importance of BPM in academia is demonstrated by its constant presence among top-ranked information system conferences [32, 2, 1, 271]. In fact, this also highlights that BPM has become one of the core areas of information systems research. The range of addressed topics goes from general organizational aspects of BPM to specific technical issues concerning business process models. Due to the importance of business process models for documenting and redesigning the operations of companies, many researchers have focused on aspects of process model design and process model quality. Nevertheless, there are still many significant aspects that have not been addressed by prior research.},

To reduce the time and effort needed to repair such situations, this paper presents the first approach to automatically identify inconsistencies between a process model and a corresponding textual description. Our approach leverages natural language processing techniques to identify cases where the two process representations describe activities in different orders, as well as model activities that are missing from the textual description. A quantitative evaluation with 46 real-life model-text pairs demonstrates that our approach allows users to quickly and effectively identify those descriptions in a process repository that are inconsistent.},

This paper picks up this challenge and faces the problem of ambiguities by acknowledging its existence and mitigating it. Specifically, we propose a framework to partially automate the elicitation of a formal representation of a textual process description, via text annotation techniques on top of natural language processing. The result is the ATDP language, whose syntax and semantics are described in this paper. ATDP allows to explicitly cope with several interpretations of the same textual description of a process model. Moreover, we link the ATDP language to a formal reasoning engine and show several use cases.

There are several implicit contextual dimensions, that are difficult to model as all situations cannot be anticipated a priori. Context mining involves analysis of process logs to identify context and correlate with process performance indicators or outcomes. In this work, we leverage unstructured data available in user comments or mails to discover implicit context of the process.

Annotated textual descriptions of processes are a good compromise between understandability (since at the end, it is just text), and behavior. Moreover, as it has been recently acknowledged, obtaining annotated textual descriptions of processes opens the door to unprecedented applications, like formal reasoning or simulation on the underlying described process. Applying our technique on several publicly available texts shows promising results in terms of precision and recall with respect to the state-of-the art approach for a similar task.},

The wide variety of data that can be included in an event log refer to information about the activity, such as what, who or where. In this paper, we focus on event logs that include textual information written in a natural language that contains exhaustive descriptions of activity executions. In this context, a pre-processing step is necessary since textual information is unstructured and it can contain inaccuracies that will provoke the impracticability of process mining techniques. For this reason, we propose a methodology that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to raw event log by relabelling activities. The approach let the customised description of the measurement and assessment of the event log quality depending on expert requirements. Additionally, it guides the selection of the most suitable NLP techniques for use depending on the event log.

This task involves the definition of measurable Process Performance Indicators (PPIs), which in many cases are calculated based on data recorded in an event log. An inhibitor of effective performance analysis is that establishing PPI definitions measurable from event logs is highly complex, because it requires process analytical expertise, as well as in-depth knowledge about the structure and contents of the available event data. Given that managers typically do not have such knowledge, this means that those stakeholders that are generally most interested in measuring process performance cannot do so in a convenient manner. Recognizing this, we bridge this gap by proposing an approach for the measurement of process performance based on textual descriptions and event logs, which combines state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques with matching strategies that are tailored to the task at hand. Evaluation experiments using textual descriptions provided by both industry and academic users demonstrate the accuracy of our approach.},

However, the starting point of any process mining analysis is an event log, which is typically not readily available in practice. The extraction of event logs from the relevant databases is a manual and highly time-consuming task, and often a hurdle for the application of process mining altogether. Available support for event log extraction comes with different assumptions and requirements and only provides limited automated support. In this paper, we therefore take a novel angle at supporting event log extraction. The core idea of our paper is to use an existing process model as a starting point and automatically identify to which database tables the activities of the considered process model relate to. Based on the resulting mapping, an event log can then be extracted in an automated fashion. We use this paper to define a first approach that is able to identify such a mapping between a process model and a database. We evaluate our approach using three real-world databases and five process models from the purchase-to-pay domain. The results of our evaluation show that our approach has the potential to successfully support event log extraction based on matching.},

Hence, many organizations complement these models with textual descriptions that specify additional details. The problem with this supplementary use of textual descriptions is that existing techniques for automatically searching process repositories are limited to process models. They are not capable of taking the information from textual descriptions into account and, therefore, provide incomplete search results. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a technique that is capable of searching textual as well as model-based process descriptions. It automatically extracts process information from both descriptions types and stores it in a unified data format. An evaluation with a large Austrian bank demonstrates that the additional consideration of textual descriptions allows us to identify more relevant processes from a repository.},

	abstract = {The continuous digitization requires organizations to improve the automation of their business processes. Among others, this has lead to an increased interest in Robotic Process Automation (RPA). RPA solutions emerge in the form of software that automatically executes repetitive and routine tasks. While the benefits of RPA on cost savings and other relevant performance indicators have been demonstrated in different contexts, one of the key challenges for RPA endeavors is to effectively identify processes and tasks that are suitable for automation. Textual process descriptions, such as work instructions, provide rich and important insights about this matter. However, organizations often maintain hundreds or even thousands of them, which makes a manual analysis unfeasible for larger organizations. Recognizing the large manual effort required to determine the current degree of automation in an organization’s business processes, we use this paper to propose an approach that is able to automatically do so. More specifically, we leverage supervised machine learning to automatically identify whether a task described in a textual process description is manual, an interaction of a human with an information system or automated. An evaluation with a set of 424 activities from a total of 47 textual process descriptions demonstrates that our approach produces satisfactory results.},

In this work, we propose a solution for NLP library selection when the effectiveness is unknown. We use the NLP libraries together in a combined method. Our combined method can utilize the strengths of different NLP libraries to obtain accurate results. The combination is conducted through two steps, i.e., document-level selection of NLP library and sentence-level overwriting. In document-level selection of primary library, the results are obtained from the library that has the highest overall accuracy. Through sentence-level overwriting, the possible fine-gained improvements from other libraries are extracted to overwrite the outputs of primary library. We evaluate the combined method with 4 widely used NLP libraries and 200 documents from 3 different sources. The results show that the combined method can generally outperform all the studied NLP libraries in terms of accuracy. The finding means that our combined method can be used instead of individual NLP library for more effective results.},

The manual discovery of declarative process models from texts is particularly hard as users have difficulties identifying textual fragments denoting business rules. Our framework combines machine-learning and expert system techniques in order to provide an algorithmic solution to discovery.

Most of the existing matching techniques rely on the use of labels, structure or execution behavior of process models. The effectiveness of these techniques is, however, quiet low and far from being usable in practice.

Recognizing the diverse usability of abstract models, a plethora of process model abstraction techniques have been proposed. However, these techniques treat process fragments as black box and replace the fragments for abstraction, without taking into consideration the semantics of activities. Consequently, the Business Significant Activities (BSA) inside the black box are also eliminated, which impedes the robustness of abstraction. To address that problem, in this paper, we have proposed an activity-based approach in which all BSAs, including the ones inside process fragments, are preserved. Specifically, we have employed a systematic and rigorous procedure to develop a benchmark collection of 960 process models. The collection includes 240 source process models and 720 process models abstracted at three levels of granularity. Subsequently, we have evaluated the effectiveness of eight activity-ranking techniques for identifying BSAs. The results show, there is no universal technique that achieve higher accuracy for all types of process models. However, in majority of the cases, Word Frequency, Word Co-occurrence and Label Centrality are the top performing techniques for identifying business significant activities.},

A downside of conformance checking, though, is that it requires a process model as a basis, limiting its applicability, whereas existing anomaly detection techniques look for statistically infrequent behavior, even though infrequency does not necessarily imply undesirability. The recently introduced concept of semantic anomaly detection overcomes these issues by detecting behavior that stands out from a semantic point of view, such as a claim being paid after it has been rejected. In this manner, it detects behavior that is undesirable, while its grounding in natural language analysis allows it to consider behavioral regularities extracted from other processes, alleviating the need to have a process model available. However, the state-of-the-art approach for semantic anomaly detection, a rigid, rule-based approach, is limited in its scope and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a machine learning-based alternative, which uses a classifier trained to recognize whether observed process behavior is normal or anomalous. Our experiments show that this learning-based approach greatly outperforms the state of the art. Users can directly apply our approach to detect semantic anomalies in their own event data by using one of our pre-trained classifiers, even if their data contains so far unseen process behavior.},

While many model properties can already be checked automatically, there is a notable gap of techniques for checking linguistic aspects such as naming conventions of process model elements. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing an automatic technique for detecting violations of naming conventions. This technique is based on text corpora and independent of linguistic resources such as WordNet. Therefore, it can be easily adapted to the broad set of languages for which corpora exist. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique by analyzing nine process model collections from practice, including over 27,000 labels and covering three different languages. The results of the evaluation show that our technique yields stable results and can reliably deal with ambiguous cases. In this way, this paper provides an important contribution to the field of automated quality assurance of conceptual models.},

The event logs used contain control flow information of past process executions and, often, additional information about the context in which a process ran. As the process context can add valuable information to a predictive model, recent PPM techniques often incorporate it to improve process predictions. While most techniques incorporate context information as well-structured numerical and categorical context features, only a few utilize unstructured text from process-related comment fields, emails, or documents. The few existing text-aware PPM approaches are limited in capturing semantic information, as different meanings of the same word occurring in different contexts, i.e., sentences, are ignored. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a text-aware PPM technique using contextualized word embeddings to predict the next activity and the next timestamp of running process instances. An experimental evaluation with a text-enriched real-life event log shows that our technique can outperform text-aware PPM approaches relying on non-contextualized word embeddings in terms of predictive performance.},

Existing process prediction methods are able to also exploit the data perspective of recorded events, in addition to the control-flow perspective. However, while well-structured numerical or categorical attributes are considered in many prediction techniques, almost no technique is able to utilize text documents written in natural language, which can hold information critical to the prediction task. In this paper, we illustrate the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel text-aware process prediction model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and natural language models. The proposed model can take categorical, numerical and textual attributes in event data into account to predict the activity and timestamp of the next event, the outcome, and the cycle time of a running process instance. Experiments show that the text-aware model is able to outperform state-of-the-art process prediction methods on simulated and real-world event logs containing textual data.},

This research aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to facilitate the employee selection process through latent semantic analysis (LSA), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and support vector machines (SVM). The research also compares the performance of different machine learning, text vectorization and sampling approaches on the human resource (HR) resume data. Design/methodology/approach LSA and BERT are used to discover and understand the hidden patterns from a textual resume dataset, and SVM is applied to build the screening model and improve performance. Findings Based on the results of this study, LSA and BERT are proved useful in retrieving critical topics, and SVM can optimize the prediction model performance with the help of cross-validation and variable selection strategies. Research limitations/implications The technique and its empirical conclusions provide a practical, theoretical basis and reference for HR research. Practical implications The novel methods proposed in the study can assist HR practitioners in designing and improving their existing recruitment process. The topic detection techniques used in the study provide HR practitioners insights to identify the skill set of a particular recruiting position. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first study that uses LSA, BERT, SVM and other machine learning models in human resource management and resume classification. Compared with the existing machine learning-based resume screening system, the proposed system can provide more interpretable insights for HR professionals to understand the recommendation results through the topics extracted from the resumes. The findings of this study can also help organizations to find a better and effective approach for resume screening and evaluation.},

For this, most existing approaches consider event logs as input data and therefore only depict how work was performed (as-is) and neglect information on how work should be performed (to-be), i.e., whether or not the actual execution is in compliance with the execution specified by the company or law. To bridge this gap, the presented approach considers event logs and natural language texts as input outlining rules on how resources are supposed to work together and which information may be exchanged between them. For pre-processing the natural language texts the large language model GPT-4 is utilized and its output is fed into a customized organizational mining component which delivers the to-be organizational perspective. In addition, we integrate well-known process discovery techniques from event logs to gather the as-is perspective. A comparison in the form of a graphical representation of both, the to-be and as-is perspectives, enables users to detect deviating behavior. The approach is evaluated based on a set of well-established process descriptions as well as synthetic and real-world event logs.},

However, formalized requirements are rarely available in practice, but rather embedded in regulatory documents such as the GDPR, requiring extraction and formalization by experts. Due to the vast amount and frequent changes in regulatory documents, it is almost impossible to keep formalized requirements up to date in a manual way. Therefore, this paper presents an approach towards compliance verification between natural language text and event logs without the need for requirements formalization. This enables humans to cope with an increasingly complex environment. The approach focuses on quantitative temporal requirements (QTCR) and consists of multiple steps. First, we identify clauses with temporal expressions from process descriptions. Second, we generate a set of QTCR by mapping the retrieved clauses to event log activities. Finally, in the third step, we verify that the event log is compliant with the QTCR. The approach is evaluated based on process descriptions and synthesized event logs. For the latter, we implement time shifting as a concept for simulating real-life logs with varying temporal challenges.},

In this work, we propose an activity mining technique, which receives an incoming email message, classifies the sender’s intent and translates it into a set of business process activities. Specifically, we leverage deep learning language models to first classify the email body into a group of intents, which are then mapped to related activities. To our knowledge, we propose the first transfer-learning based solution for mining activity information from emails. The effectiveness of our solution was evaluated on real-world data coming from email exchanges between knowledge workers.

However, the time-consuming but required step of designing formal business process models often hampers the potential of these systems. To overcome this challenge, automated generation of business process models from natural language text has emerged as a promising approach to expedite this step. Generally two crucial subtasks have to be solved: extracting process-relevant information from natural language and creating the actual model. Approaches towards the first subtask are rule based methods, highly optimized for specific domains, but hard to adapt to related applications. To solve this issue, we present an extension to an existing pipeline, to make it entirely data driven. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our improved pipeline, which not only eliminates the substantial overhead associated with feature engineering and rule definition, but also enables adaptation to different datasets, entity and relation types, and new domains. Additionally, the largest available dataset (PET) for the first subtask, contains no information about linguistic references between mentions of entities in the process description. Yet, the resolution of these mentions into a single visual element is essential for high quality process models. We propose an extension to the PET dataset that incorporates information about linguistic references and a corresponding method for resolving them. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the inherent challenges in the dataset at hand.},

	abstract = {Business process redesign (BPR) is widely recognized as a key phase of the business process management lifecycle. However, the existing studies have focused on proposing theoretical models, methodologies, and redesign patterns, whereas, the BPR activity remains dependent upon domain experts with little or no consideration to end-user feedback. To facilitate these experts, in this study, we have proposed a natural language processing (NLP) based approach to identify redesign suggestions from end-user feedback in natural language text. The proposed approach includes a novel set of annotation guidelines that can be used to generate computational resources for business process redesign. Secondly, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have generated computational resources which are composed of three real-world business processes and end-user feedback containing 8421 sentences. Finally, we have performed 270 experiments using six traditional and three deep learning techniques to evaluate their effectiveness for the identification of redesign suggestions from raw text. The classified suggestions can be used by domain experts to prioritize the redesign possibilities, without going through the details of the customer feedback.},

	abstract = {The constantly growing body of global environmental legislation necessitates that corporate environmental compliance managers frequently assess the relevance of new regulations and regulation revisions for each of their sites. Companies are pressured to streamline and automate this crucial task through digital workflows and specialized IT-based assistance systems. This has recently piqued the interest of researchers working in different disciplines, such as intelligent systems, machine learning, and natural language processing. The article describes the latest results of our long-term research program on IT-based support for corporate compliance management, offering insights for these, and other disciplines. The context and the main aspects of environmental regulation announcements and the relevance assessment task are analyzed. An extensive conceptual data model is developed that serves as a foundation for tailoring a generic method to perform a relevance assessment that considers site-specific individual environmental compliance facts. The method uses heuristic data operations and various text processing techniques from the field of natural language understanding. In order to exemplify the method, two application scenarios are described in which the relevance of new waste management directives are assessed for a multi-site production company.},

However, this data is unstructured and scattered, making its utilization difficult from an academic and industrial point of view. This work aims to develop a recommendation system to identify optimal process conditions and catalyst information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. To this end, full-text articles were extracted using the Elsevier API key followed by a custom XML parser. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was applied on this dataset to form clusters of topics. The experimental section of each article is annotated using state-of-the-art sentiment analysis techniques and divided into four categories based on the presence of catalyst and process information. This dataset is used to develop a dedicated NLP model, “Ex-SciBERT” by performing transfer learning on the “Sci-BERT” model. This model performs classification followed by Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract catalyst and process parameters. Ex-SciBERT model produces an accuracy score of 0.915 (train dataset) and 0.890 (test dataset) for the classification of sentences task and an excellent accuracy score of 0.998 (train dataset) and 0.997 (test dataset) for the NER task. Deployment of this model will automate and accelerate the screening of relevant information from literature by reducing manual efforts.},

	abstract = {Aspect term sentiment classification (ATSC) aims at identifying sentiment polarities towards some aspect terms described in a text. One of the challenges in the ATSC is that the same word may express different sentiment polarities for distinct aspects. For instance, if the word “high” is used to describe the quality of a product, this word is most likely used to express a positive opinion towards the product. However, if the aspect term is about the price of the product, the same word “high” is quite likely used to represent a negative sentiment polarity. Such aspect-sensitive word features are also useful for the ATSC when the comparative forms are used to express opinions. What sentiment or opinion is expressed largely depends on who we compare with and how we compare. We describe a weakly supervised method to create an aspect-sensitive lexicon for each aspect, which is a relatively accurate representation of the sentiments that are related to that aspect. We also propose a sentiment analysis model enhanced with the learned aspect-sensitive word embeddings, and extensive experiments show that this model achieved state-of-the-art performances on multiple datasets.},

In this paper, we address this problem by presenting the Business Process Model Translator (BPMT), a technique for the automated translation of business process models that eases the re-use of business process models and reduces redundant work in multi-national companies. It builds upon the state-of-the-art machine translation system Moses and extends it with word and translation disambiguation considering the context of the domain. As a result, the BPMT can successfully deal with the compact and special language fragments that are typically found in business process models.

The present paper addresses this demand by developing a framework for context awareness based on process executions-related textual data using a well-established layered BPM context model. This framework combines and maps various text analytics techniques to the layers of the context model, aiming to increase the context awareness of process workers and facilitate informed decision-making. The framework is applied in an IT ticket processing case study.

As a framework for contextualizing the potential, as well as the limitations of LLMs and other foundation model-based technologies, we propose the concept of a Large Process Model (LPM) that combines the correlation power of LLMs with the analytical precision and reliability of knowledge-based systems and automated reasoning approaches. LPMs are envisioned to directly utilize the wealth of process management experience that experts have accumulated, as well as process performance data of organizations with diverse characteristics, e.g., regarding size, region, or industry. In this vision, the proposed LPM would allow organizations to receive context-specific (tailored) process and other business models, analytical deep-dives, and improvement recommendations. As such, they would allow to substantially decrease the time and effort required for business transformation, while also allowing for deeper, more impactful, and more actionable insights than previously possible. We argue that implementing an LPM is feasible, but also highlight limitations and research challenges that need to be solved to implement particular aspects of the LPM vision.},

	abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) is gaining increasing attention as it has the potential to cut costs while boosting output and quality. Business process document generation is a crucial stage in BPM. However, due to a shortage of datasets, data-driven deep learning techniques struggle to deliver the expected results. We propose an approach to transform Conditional Process Trees (CPTs) into Business Process Text Sketches (BPTSs) using Large Language Models (LLMs). The traditional prompting approach (Few-shot In-Context Learning) tries to get the correct answer in one go, and it can find the pattern of transforming simple CPTs into BPTSs, but for close-domain and CPTs with complex hierarchy, the traditional prompts perform weakly and with low correctness. We suggest using this technique to break down a difficult CPT into a number of basic CPTs and then solve each one in turn, drawing inspiration from the divide-and-conquer strategy. We chose 100 process trees with depths ranging from 2 to 5 at random, as well as CPTs with many nodes, many degrees of selection, and cyclic nesting. Experiments show that our method can achieve a correct rate of 93.42\%, which is 45.17\% better than traditional prompting methods. Our proposed method provides a solution for business process document generation in the absence of datasets, and secondly, it becomes potentially possible to provide a large number of datasets for the process model extraction (PME) domain.},

Available techniques employ various models and different types of input data to produce accurate predictions. However, from a practical perspective, explainability is another important requirement besides accuracy since predictive process monitoring techniques frequently support decision-making in critical domains. Techniques from the area of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aim to provide this capability and create transparency and interpretability for black-box ML models. While several explainable predictive process monitoring techniques exist, none of them leverages textual data. This is surprising since textual data can provide a rich context to a process that numerical features cannot capture. Recognizing this, we use this paper to investigate how the combination of textual and non-textual data can be used for explainable predictive process monitoring and analyze how the incorporation of textual data affects both the predictions and the explainability. Our experiments show that using textual data requires more computation time but can lead to a notable improvement in prediction quality with comparable results for explainability.},

This work presents Declo, a chatbot that allows users to easily deﬁne declarative constraints using natural language statements provided in the form of vocal or textual input.

Recently, there have been several initiatives to extend the scope of these analysis to consider heterogeneous and unstructured data sources. More precisely, email analysis has attracted much attention as emailing system is considered as one of the principal channel to support the execution of business processes (BP). However, given the unstructured nature of email logs data, process mining techniques could not be applied directly; thus it is necessary to generate structured event logs. Activities form a cornerstone component of BP that must be identified to obtain such structured logs. In this paper we propose to discover frequent activities from email logs. Existing approaches are usually supervised or require human intervention. In addition, they do not take into consideration activity business data (BD) perspective. In this paper, we introduce a pattern discovery based approach to tackle these limitations; we suggest mainly to discover frequent activities and their BD with unsupervised way. Additionally, our approach allows the detection of multiple activities per email and the automatic generation of their names while reducing human intervention. We validate our work using a public email dataset. We publicly provide our results to be a first step towards ensuring reproducibility in the studied area, which allows more practical analysis for further research.},

Existing techniques for this task are primarily frequency-based, arguing that behavior is anomalous because it is uncommon. However, such techniques ignore the semantics of recorded events and, therefore, do not take the meaning of potential anomalies into consideration. In this work, we overcome this caveat and focus on the detection of anomalies from a semantic perspective, arguing that anomalies can be recognized when process behavior does not make sense. To achieve this, we propose an approach that exploits the natural language associated with events. Our key idea is to detect anomalous process behavior by identifying semantically inconsistent execution patterns. To detect such patterns, we first automatically extract business objects and actions from the textual labels of events. We then compare these against a process-independent knowledge base. By populating this knowledge base with patterns from various kinds of resources, our approach can be used in a range of contexts and domains. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to successfully detect semantic execution anomalies through an evaluation based on a set of real-world and synthetic event logs and show the complementary nature of semantics-based anomaly detection to existing frequency-based techniques.},

GPT is trained on massive amounts of text data and uses deep learning techniques to learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. This position paper proposes using GPT technology to generate new process models when/if needed. We introduce ProcessGPT as a new technology that has the potential to enhance decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data. This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, supporting evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process augmentation, automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes.

Traditionally, most BPM decisions and activities are undertaken by business stakeholders based on manual data collection and analysis techniques. This is time-consuming and potentially leads to suboptimal decisions, as only a restricted subset of data and options are considered. Over the past decades, a rich set of data-driven techniques has emerged to support and automate various activities and decisions across the BPM lifecycle, particularly within the process mining field. More recently, the uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) methods for BPM has led to a range of approaches for proactive business process monitoring. Given their common data requirements and overlapping goals, process mining and AI-driven approaches to business process optimization are converging. This convergence is leading to a promising emerging concept, which we call (AI-)augmented process execution: a collection of data analytics and artificial intelligence methods for continuous and automated improvement and adaptation of business processes. This article gives an outline of research at the intersection between process mining and AI-driven process optimization, classifies the researched techniques based on their scope and objectives, and positions augmented process execution as an additional layer on top of this stack.},

Especially in service processes, such as the incident management process, a variety of unstructured information is created throughout the execution, representing a relevant use case for incorporating (multilingual) text. To close this research gap, a method exploiting multilingual text for predicting the outcome of a service process is presented. Multilingual large language models are used to generate sentence embeddings for unstructured text created during process execution. After instantiating the method, an evaluation was performed using a real-life event log to predict customer satisfaction in the incident management process at a German multinational corporation.

	abstract = {Process mining is concerned with the analysis of organizational processes based on event data recorded during their execution. Foundational process mining techniques analyze such data in an abstract manner, without taking the meaning of these events or their payload into consideration. By contrast, other techniques may exploit specific kinds of information contained in event data, such as resources in organizational mining and business objects in object-centric analysis, to gain more specific insights into an organization’s operations. However, the information required for such analyses is typically not readily available. Rather, the meaning of events is often captured in an ad hoc manner, commonly through unstructured textual attributes, such as an event’s label, or in unclearly named attributes. In this work, we address this gap by proposing an approach for the automatic annotation of semantic components in event logs. To achieve this, we combine the analysis of textual attribute values, based on a state-of-the-art language model, with novel attribute classification and component categorization techniques. In this manner, our approach first identifies up to eight semantic components per event, revealing information on the actions, business objects, and resources recorded in an event log. Afterwards, our approach further categorizes the identified actions and actors, allowing for a more in-depth analysis of key process perspectives. We demonstrate our approach’s efficacy through an evaluation using a broad range of event logs and highlight its usefulness through four application scenarios enabled by our approach.},

Despite the relevance of process simulation as a tool for planning business process improvements, the adoption of process simulation is hampered by the fact that the specification of what-if scenarios requires technical knowledge. This paper presents Coral, a chatbot that allows business users to specify what-if scenarios in a conversational manner. Coral takes as input a process simulation model, and enables users to interactively configure what-if scenarios in business terms. Coral also allows users to compare the performance of the process under the what-if scenario versus its performance under a baseline scenario.},

	abstract = {GPT-3 and several other language models (LMs) can effectively address various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation and text summarization. Recently, they have also been successfully employed in the business process management (BPM) domain, e.g., for predictive process monitoring and process extraction from text. This, however, typically requires fine-tuning the employed LM, which, among others, necessitates large amounts of suitable training data. A possible solution to this problem is the use of prompt engineering, which leverages pre-trained LMs without fine-tuning them. Recognizing this, we argue that prompt engineering can help bring the capabilities of LMs to BPM research. We use this position paper to develop a research agenda for the use of prompt engineering for BPM research by identifying the associated potentials and challenges.},
